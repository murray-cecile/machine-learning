## TO DO:


### explore data
- **CORRELATION MATRIX/PLOT**
- you have too many horrible tables
- make plots less horrible?

### process data
- what to do about zip codes
- check if other variables are NA

### build classifer
meh, okay for now

### evaluate
- **evaluate criterion and combine with threshold and max depth**

### WRITE UP WHAT I DID
- justify choice of variables
