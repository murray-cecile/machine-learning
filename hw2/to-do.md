## TO DO:

*STOP EXPLORING THE DATA: MOVE ON TO DOING ML*

### explore data
- pairwise plots! showing how target variable varies with different features
- get univariate distribution plots to appear in sequence
- generally make plots less horrible

### process data
- [what if a variable isn't numeric? e.g. zip code]

### build classifer
- made crappy decision tree, should add some params

### evaluate
- actually build eval fns

### WRITE UP WHAT I DID
- justify choice of variables
