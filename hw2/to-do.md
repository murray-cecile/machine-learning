## TO DO:

*STOP EXPLORING THE DATA: MOVE ON TO DOING ML*

### explore data
- pairwise plot function
- get univariate distribution plots to appear in sequence

### process data
- [what if a variable isn't numeric? e.g. zip code]

### generate features
- figure out cut
- decide how to implement make_dummy for continuous

### build classifer
- everything, also which model???

### evaluate
- everything
